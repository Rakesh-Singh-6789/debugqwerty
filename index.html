    <p>Comments to the rescue: Most modern languages have declarative documented comments, and their use, in conjunction with single and multi-line comments, makes code more understandable â€” and, hence, maintainable.
      Good code comments explain why things are done, not what is done. The code itself explains what is done. The need for comments should be minimal.
      <h1>Indentation</h1>
      Good code is properly structured, as shown in the figure. It should be obvious for the person trying to understand code where a block of code starts and where it ends, so that following the logic of the code base becomes evident and straightforward.</p>
